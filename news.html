    <img class="image" src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB1pH07C.img?w=612&h=344&m=6&x=302&y=122&s=553&d=176" alt="Google Logo">
    <p class="content">On July 6, 2014, the Facebook Page The Patriots Network published a post with an image positing that tech magnate Elon Musk was going to buy the U.S. television network ABC in order to cancel one of its flagship shows, "The View":
    The post had obtained 21,000 reactions and 2,800 comments as of this writing. Commenters reacted in agreement. "Yes!! Most despicable talk show with a bunch of haters… cancel asap," one demanded. "Oh I hope so, they are the most prejudice people, they thrive on hateful talk especially," another one added, indignant.
    The pinned comment under the post linked to an article on the website SpacexMania.com. The article relayed the same allegation:
    Breaking: Elon Musk Is Considering Owning ABC, "I'm Going To Cancel Woke The View"
    In the latest chapter of his entrepreneurial saga, Elon Musk is reportedly considering the acquisition of ABC, one of the largest and most influential television networks in the United States. This potential move comes with a bold promise to "cancel woke The View," a statement that has already sparked considerable controversy and debate.
    This item was not a factual recounting of real-life events. First, we ran the text of the article through several artificial intelligence (AI) detectors, including writer.com, CopyLeaks, and ZeroGPT, all of which identified it as AI-generated.
    Further, the article originated with a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature, as follows:
    Our mission? To bring you the freshest fake news, some sassy analysis, and a good dose of satire, all rolled into one crazy concoction that orbits around Elon Musk and everything that's lighting up the viral/trending charts.
    The Facebook page of The Patriots Network confirmed this, disclaiming "The Patriots Network is a Network of Satire and Parody affiliated with SpacexMania.com." Lastly, the post itself noted that it was satire: "Elon Musk is going to cancel The View tv show - Satire."
    We're written about similar stories before, in May 2022 and in April 2024.
    For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.</p></div>

    <img class="image" src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/man-dead-metro.jpg?w=640" alt="Google Logo">
    <p class="content">A 68-year-old man allegedly died by suicide on Thursday by jumping before a Metro train at the Kashmere Gate station, officials said. The man was identified as Sunil Gupta, a resident of Chawari Bazar. According to the police, he was suffering from tuberculosis for the past few years and had spent more than Rs 6 lakh on his treatment. Police recovered a suicide note from the person. The body was sent for an autopsy, PTI reported.

DU to start teaching Manusmriti: Delhi University’s Faculty of Law is planning to introduce the Manusmriti, the ancient Sanskrit text, in its undergraduate programme under the paper called Jurisprudence (Legal Method), prompting a certain section of faculty members in the varsity to raise concern over the move. The revised syllabus document will be placed before DU’s Academic Council for Academic Matters on Friday to pass its implementation in the upcoming academic session in August.

In other news, Supreme Court judge Justice Sanjay Kumar Thursday recused himself from hearing pleas by jailed AAP leader Manish Sisodia on reviving his bail petitions in the Delhi excise policy case. A bench including Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Karol stated that another bench without Justice Kumar would hear the pleas on July 15.  In another excise policy case against jailed CM Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi HC will hear on September 9 the CM’s petition challenging the ED summons in the money laundering case.</p></div>

    <img class="image" src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/investigation-overlay-1600x900-1.jpg?w=640" alt="Google Logo">
    <p class="content">In the fractious campaign of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Ayodhya (Faizabad) seat saw a defeat for the ruling BJP and victory for the SP candidate. On the ground, though, after the January inauguration of the Ram temple, a massive public-private development package has turned land into prime real estate and blurred many a dividing line.

An investigation by The Indian Express of land registries — since the Supreme Court verdict allowing the Ram temple in November 2019 and upto March 2024 — show an upto 30 per cent rise in the number of land transactions in at least 25 villages in Ayodhya and adjoining districts Gonda and Basti that fall within a radius of 15 km of the temple. Many of these deals are by family members or those closely linked to politicians across parties and government officials.

1. Arunachal Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein: His sons Chau Kaan Seng Mein and Aditya Mein bought 3.99 hectares for Rs 3.72 crore between September 2022 and September 2023 in Maheshpur (Gonda), 8 km from the temple, across the Sarayu river separating Ayodhya and Gonda. On April 25, 2023, they sold 0.768 hectares for Rs 98 lakh. Aditya Mein said, “We have bought the land for tourism development. We will build a hotel and also do some landscaping.” In June this year, Mein was sworn in again as Deputy CM in the new Arunachal Cabinet.

2. BJP ex-MP Brij Bhushan Singh: His son Karan Bhushan owns Nandini Infrastructure, which bought 0.97 hectares in Maheshpur (Gonda), 8 km from the temple, in January 2023 for Rs 1.15 crore. From this parcel, he sold 635.72 sq m for Rs 60.96 lakh in July 2023. Karan Bhushan was elected as the new BJP MP of Kaiserganj in June 2024. Brij Bhushan is the former national wrestling federation chief who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by top wrestlers. He did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div>

    <img class="image" src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/jk-terror-attack.jpg?w=640" alt="Google Logo">
    <p class="content">The security-centric approach has obvious limitations in obtaining an enduring change in Pakistan’s behaviour towards us, especially in view of the growing China-Pakistan military nexus and the nuclear dimension. (File photo)

Seven security personnel have lost their lives to terror in Jammu and Kashmir in the last two days, close on the heels of four back-to-back terror attacks in June. Pakistan’s involvement has been reported. These tragic incidents are a reminder that after over four decades of suffering Pakistan-sponsored terror, and despite numerous peace initiatives and 10 years of avowed muscularity from us, our goal to put an end to it remains unaccomplished.

The attacks have brutally shattered the complacency of a section of our strategic community and in the minds of the public over Pakistan’s relative restraint on its terror apparatus in recent years. The intractable internal challenges faced by the Pakistani state, especially since 2021, and the changed geopolitical dynamics, have been seen as signs of its impending collapse. Though sporadic Pakistan-sponsored terror in Jammu and Kashmir never ceased, the sense of complacency has also been buttressed by a tendency among some to overestimate the impact of our muscular approach, including revocation of the special status of J&K, in largely containing, if not putting an end to, our Pakistan problem.

The fact, however, is this: Pakistan is nowhere close to a collapse. No major country desires this outcome in a highly volatile space with a nuclear arsenal. Second, there has been no sign of the Pakistani establishment abnegating terrorism. It has been merely calibrating and adapting its terror activity by, inter alia, taking out the notorious faces of its terror machine in response to the Financial Action Task Force scrutiny and our security/punitive measures. Third, the revocation of the special status of J&K has not put an end to the Pakistan dimension of our problem there. Pakistan’s questioning of the accession of J&K to India preceded the introduction of Article 370 in our Constitution and has outlasted its revocation. The terror attacks are an attempt to stay relevant to the situation in J&K and queer the pitch for the assembly election.</p></div>

    <img class="image" src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/ajit-pawar-4.jpg?w=640" alt="Google Logo">
    <p class="content">His prestige having taken a severe beating in the recent Lok Sabha polls, where his faction of the NCP just won one seat, there is a new Ajit Pawar to the fore ahead of the Assembly elections and the coming Maharashtra Legislative Council elections.

On Tuesday, the NCP national president was at Mumbai’s Siddhivinayak Temple, where he and party leader Praful Patel attended the “abhishek” ceremony. On Sunday, he personally welcomed Sant Tukaram Maharaj Palkhi, part of the Pandharpur pilgrimage, to his hometown of Baramati. Keeping his word in the Assembly that he would be walking along with the pilgrims or ‘warkaris’ when they pass through Baramati, the Deputy Chief Minister joined them in traditional attire, accompanied by wife Sunetra. Along the way, he played the traditional musical instruments that the devotees carry.

Party insiders admit that these public displays of piety from Ajit, a veteran politician who has long worked on the ground in these parts, are rare.

Even the Budget that he presented in the Assembly as Finance Minister last week had a gift for the warkaris – Rs 20,000 for every ”dindi’ (or group of them) participating in the Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj and Sant Tukaram Maharaj palkhis to Pandharpur.

These measures by Ajit come in the wake of the Lok Sabha polls, where the NCP did not just finish last among the six major parties in the fray, Sunetra also lost the prestigious Baramati battle to Sharad Pawar-led NCP’s Supriya Sule.</p></div>

    <p class="content">Preliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance

Mains Examination: GS-II, GS-III: Agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests, Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation, environmental impact assessment, Biodiversity

What’s the ongoing story- Amitabh Sinha Writes–-“The Indian government on Monday said it would soon sign and ratify the High Seas Treaty, a new international legal architecture for maintaining the ecological health of the oceans. The treaty, negotiated last year, is meant for reducing pollution, and for conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and other marine resources in ocean waters.”

Prerequisites: 

— What are the high seas? 

— What is the significance of the high seas?

Festive offer

— Read about the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas, the Geneva Convention (1958) on the High Seas, and the Paris Agreement.

Key takeaways: 

— “High seas are areas outside the national jurisdiction of any country because of which the treaty is also known as the agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdictions (BBNJ). It is formally called the Agreement on Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction.”

— “The High Seas Treaty has often been compared with the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change in its significance and potential impact. The treaty deals only with oceans that are outside the national jurisdiction of any country. Typically, national jurisdictions extend up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the coastline, an area that is called exclusive economic zones or EEZs. Areas outside of EEZs of every country are known as high seas or international waters. They belong to no one and everyone enjoys equal rights for navigation, overflight, economic activities, scientific research, or laying of infrastructure like undersea cables.”</p></div>

    <img class="image" src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/Opinion3_9th-July.jpg?w=640" alt="Google Logo">
    <p class="content">Since its inception about a decade ago, the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) has been a politically contentious issue in Tamil Nadu. The recent turn of events has made it a national issue. NEET was originally conceptualised to ensure merit-based selection to medical schools and standardise the medical entrance process. It was seen as a solution to the problem of high capitation fees being charged by private medical institutions. Has the examination achieved its intended goal? Has NEET curbed the commercialisation of medical education?

This year, more than 24 lakh candidates sat for the NEET after paying application fees ranging between Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,700. The application charges alone give a revenue of about Rs 337 crore to the testing agency. Moreover an individual candidate spends a few lakhs at coaching centres to prepare for the test.

The initial eligibility for qualification, 50 percentile, was diluted to 30 percentile in 2020 and further to zero percentile in 2023. The reason cited was that several seats are vacant in private medical colleges. However, after the 60,000 seats in government medical colleges are filled up, people’s paying capacity plays a big role in filling up the remaining 50,000 seats in private colleges. This makes the MBBS dream virtually unattainable for students of the economically weak strata, despite scoring high marks in NEET. Nearly half of the MBBS seats become a virtual preserve of the wealthy, making a mockery of the objective of rewarding merit.

NEET is one of the several alterations in the country’s medical education ecosystem in the past decade. The other changes include the dissolution of the Medical Council of India, after the agency faced corruption charges, a reduction in the faculty student ratio from 1:1 to 1:3 and public private partnership model (PPP) for developing medical colleges in each district with the entire district hospital been handed over to a private player. The medical sector has also seen reforms, including the Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme that allows people below the poverty line to access tertiary care and renaming the primary health centres as Ayushman Arogya Mandir with private partnership. Medical education, and healthcare in general, which was a service sector in the hands of the government, has gradually changed to a commodity with the increased participation of private players.</p></div>

    <img class="image" src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Let-higher-education-go_Premium-01.jpg?w=640" alt="Google Logo">
    <p class="content">It is hard to understand why Modi, with his ‘mission’ to make India a Vishvaguru again, has done so little to urge his chief ministers to improve government schools in BJP states.Meanwhile, the rot that is tumbling out daily from our National Testing Agency can be turned into an opportunity if Modi seriously wants India to become the centre of learning that it was in ancient times. (Representational)

First, a confession. I regret that I have not written earlier about the rot in higher education that has been revealed in shameful detail in recent days. I should have done so because I believe deeply that the reforms most urgently needed are those in higher education. In school education as well. But that is a whole other story. It disappoints me that the Prime Minister has not done anything by way of real education reforms in the past ten years.

My disappointment began when he made Smriti Irani his first education minister. I had hoped he would find a minister with some understanding of academia. But I went anyway to meet her and suggested that the best thing she could do for higher education was to disband the University Grants Commission (UGC), and allow colleges and universities full autonomy to govern themselves. She paid no attention. She was more interested in trying to sack the Vice-Chancellor of Delhi University, who was showing signs of independence and imagination.

The liberation of higher education from the clutches of officials and politicians is a cause I have been passionately interested in almost since I first started writing this column nearly forty years ago. This was a cause inspired by observing how almost every major political leader tried to start his own private college. Not out of altruism. But for power, patronage and land-grabbing. I also know from non-political friends who run fine colleges and universities about how much interference they face from politicians who try their best to grab these institutions for themselves. If they succeed, they sell off the land to make a fortune from the real estate business.</p></div>

    <img class="image" src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/Eresearch-feature_21fbb3.jpg?w=640" alt="Google Logo">
    <p class="content">Amidst the bustling bazaars of Central Kolkata, the striking grey and blue Cathedral of the Most Holy Rosary stands tall. Known locally as the Portuguese Church, it offers a rare glimpse into the city’s often-overlooked Portuguese heritage.

Father Franklin Menezes notes that, despite its 1690 origins, the Portuguese influence on the church’s administration has been minimal. “Same is the case with the two other Portuguese churches in the city,” he says, referring to the Sacred Heart of Jesus on Lenin Sarani and the Church of Our Lady of Dolours in Sealdah Market. Both churches severed ties with the Portuguese Mission in 1844 and the 1930s respectively, and now lie forgotten.

Although the Portuguese had arrived before the British, they were seen, as historian George Winus describes, as a “shadow empire”. The Portuguese operated in the capacity of privateers, freebooters, convicts, and adventurers. Despite this, they had a significant influence on all things Bengali.

“The Portuguese in Bengal were an important part of both, the history of the Portuguese imperial presence in Asia as well as the history of early modern Bengal. As traders, sailors, mercenaries, and settlers, they participated and intervened in historical processes,” says Radhika Chadha, Associate Professor of History at Miranda House, Delhi University.</p></div>
<div class="article"><h1 class="heading">PM Modi’s first bilateral visit this term: Russia’s importance for India</h1>
    <img class="image" src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/Putin-Modi-1.jpg?w=640" alt="Google Logo">
    <p class="content">Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin on Monday (July 8) and Tuesday. The two leaders have met a total 16 times since Modi became Prime Minister, but not since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, provoking wide-ranging Western sanctions. Modi last went to Russia for the Eastern Economic Forum meeting in Vladivostok in September 2019; Putin last visited India in December 2021 for the annual bilateral summit.

In choosing Russia for his first bilateral visit after being sworn in, Modi has broken with the tradition of India’s new Prime Minister travelling first to a neighbouring country, a template that he followed in both June 2014 (Bhutan) and June 2019 (Maldives and Sri Lanka). He travelled to Italy last month, but that was for a multilateral meeting of G7 leaders.

The visit to Russia is a statement of the importance New Delhi accords to its relationship with Moscow, and an underlining of this foreign policy priority. Modi will be meeting Putin around the same time as leaders of the 32 nations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) gather in Washington DC from July 9-11 to celebrate 75 years of the anti-Russia military alliance.

India’s relationship with Russia is seven decades old. Veteran Indian policymakers carry fond memories of the generosity and friendship of the USSR, a goodwill that has been transferred to the relationship with Russia — even though the transactional approach of the Kremlin today is qualitatively very different from the worldview and priorities of the leadership of the erstwhile Soviet Union.

Over the years, as India has diversified its relationships in a multi-polar world, the India-Russia relationship has stagnated in some areas and atrophied in others. Defence is the strongest pillar of the strategic partnership by far, with nuclear and space cooperation also occupying an important place.</p></div>
